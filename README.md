# Minesweeper
(yes, I'm collaborating with myself on this project, my git accounts are a bit jumbled)
This project has two parts:
A. Fully functional Minesweeper game. For the purpose of part B, it will always be 15 by 30, with 40 bombs.
B. An interface that allows various AI's to "play" Minesweeper. The program will create an extension of
	the Analyzer class and repeatedly give it the board state, then ask it for the next move.
C. A challenge. Try to construct an algorithm that wins Minesweeper the highest percentage of the time.
   Until I find a better idea, it will be measured by wins out of 1000.
